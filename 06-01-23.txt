Title: Now that Reddit are killing 3rd party apps on July 1st what are great alternatives to Reddit? Score: 41670 ID: 13x9sy7
Top Comments:Comment 0: Without this app, I will actually stop using Reddit.
Comment 1: If Reddit Is Fun goes down, I'm out. If old.reddit.com goes down, I'm out.   

Reddit's UIs are trash enough to drive me away.
Comment 2: The data needed to view the official app is RIDICULOUS. I can suck through Gb’s a day easily so never use it when not on Wi-Fi. 
Also the ads. They’re getting worse. More frequent and shady quality. No doubt this will ramp up when there’s no alternative.
Comment 3: Digg.

It's time to go full circle.
Comment 4: [removed]
Comment 5: Reddit: Alright 3rd party app developers, we're going public and all that matters is stock price. We're going to start charging you.   

Developers: Ah geez ok we get it. What's the damage going to be? How much do you want? We're willing to work with y...   

Reddit: A bajillion kajillion fershmillion bucks.   

Developers: Sooo you really just want us to disappear?  

Reddit: Yes, bye.

Developers: You know lots of users are gonna lea...   

Reddit: Bye!
Comment 6: ITT: No one answering the question.
Comment 7: People here love to shit on things like Amazon, Walmart, and Netflix when it comes to business practices. This move by reddit is directly cutting out any market competitors on the way the site is accessed and giving themselves a monopoly. 

Keep in mind all they do is aggregate links from around the web THAT THE USERS SUBMIT and any OC generated here is again by the users via OC content and comments. The majority of their workforce is unpaid moderators that keep communities running. They've added premium account features, added sponsored ads that you can't interact with, and sell user data. They have the least overhead of any tech company and still want more money.

They're doing nothing to generate actual content themselves and making sure the only way you can interact with them is through their choosing. This goes against the free and open internet and net neutrality that they supposedly championed.

Imagine if a fridge manufacturer said you can only put items in the fridge that you bought through me.
Comment 8: [Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet) is still there, and will welcome  you back.

After 43 years of activity, the same flamewars are still burning.
Comment 9: Since nobody is posting actual answers: [Lemmy](https://join-lemmy.org/). I'd not heard about it before today and I don't know how well it works yet, but it seems to just be a federated version of Reddit (like Mastodon is for Twitter).

Top Comments:Comment 0: Congressional stock trading
Comment 1: Ticketmaster. Make artists sell tickets directly
Comment 2: those shitty ads on youtube that say i can get a nintedo switch for $7. why? because it's obviously a scam directed specifically at kids.
Comment 3: Child beauty pageants

Everyone involved, straight to hell.
Comment 4: The pop up adverts that trick you into clicking by making the X icon to have a box that’s only one pixel so you tap on the advert regardless.
Comment 5: Hidden fees. Including sales tax, auto gratuity, convenience fees, cleaning fees, credit card fees, All of it. 

If you want to charge it, you need to include it in the upfront cost. The price you show on the menu/advertisement/website is the price you pay at checkout. Period.
Comment 6: Road names changing anywhere along its length.  One name for the entire length.  No other road with a similar name within 20 miles.  Main St and Main Ave would require one of them getting a new name.  Roads interrupted by a building or something would need two names, one for each part.

Sorry Atlanta, you only get one Peachtree road.
Comment 7: **Content tuning algorithms on social media.** (yes, this includes you Reddit)

They all are being tuned to force feed rage bait content and it's radicalizing people and fracturing our society. A simple and effective thing to say would be "If a social media platform suggests or customizes content viewed by its users, they're responsible for the content posted and the accuracy of the content".

They can't have it both ways: force-feeding rage bait content and then waving their hands and crying foul saying that "they didn't write it so they shouldn't be responsible" when it's misinformation and propaganda.
Comment 8: I would make it counted as high treason if a politician exploits their position for their own personal gain or that of their family with a department being formed around monitoring them and their families assets with between 1-4 random checks to be completed annually
Comment 9: Lobbying

Comment 1: Ticketmaster
Comment 2: Scientology
Comment 3: The IOC. FIFA. THE NCAA.
Comment 4: Multi-Level-Marketing (MLM) corporations, e.g. Amway
Comment 5: Whomever keeps the cost of life-saving medicines like insulin so exorbitantly high. People shouldn't be driven to poverty just for surviving.
Comment 6: Nestlè, not fully destroyed. Just rebuilt from the ground up.
Comment 7: Susan G. Komen Foundation or any pink ribbon organization. Most break throughs would of happened years earlier.

Edit: I hope this brings "awareness" to their scam and how more than a $1 billion has been scammed out of research to actually find a cure.
Comment 8: Turbo tax, h&r block, etc, lobbying the government and making sure us citizens need to keep using them instead of letting the government do our taxes themselves
Comment 9: As a public defender: the entire foster care system.

Comment 2: Puff
Error: Comment contained an unreadable character!
Comment 4: if Charizard counts, then him.

if not, then it could depend on whether we are able to count all versions of Maleficient. There have been many adaptations of sleeping beauty, but even people who watched one of them might not necessary connect the dots of that character being a dragon with that name.

Other ones are toothless, tiamat, bahamut, smaug, and shenron
